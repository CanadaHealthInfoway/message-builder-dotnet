     * providers. Information captured here includes the provider 
     * making the comments; and excludes information that would 
     * render the record invalid. This information will only be 
     * seen when another provider reviews the record. Urgent or 
     * targeted messages should be sent using a different mechanism 
     * (e.g. phone).</p> <p>Public Health requires all clinical 
     * notes to be 'verified' by a responsible party if not created 
     * by physician in charge. This model conveys the correct 
     * semantics, but is inconsistent with other uses of 
     * &quot;author&quot; participation in POIZ models. Any changes 
     * here will have to be reconciled with other projects using 
     * this same cmet.</p> <p>Allows various Providers to attach 
     * comments to an existing record, and thus improving 
     * cross-provider communications.</p>
