     * Delivery Location <p>A role played by a place at which 
     * services may be provided. The RIM defines two 
     * specializations of service delivery location: 1. incidental 
     * service delivery location - A role played by a place at 
     * which health care services may be provided without prior 
     * designation or authorization and 2. dedicated service 
     * delivery location - A role played by a place that is 
     * intended to house the provision of services. Scoper is the 
     * Entity (typically Organization) that provides these 
     * services. This is not synonymous with &quot;ownership&quot;. 
     * This can be further characterized by a role code of: 
     * A)DedicatedClinicalLocationRoleType - A role of a place that 
     * further classifies the clinical setting (e.g., cardiology 
     * clinic, primary care clinic, rehabilitation hospital, 
     * skilled nursing facility) in which care is delivered during 
     * an encounter or B)DedicatedNonClinicalLocationRoleType - A 
     * role of a place that further classifies the setting in which 
     * non-clinical services are delivered. A given physical place 
     * can play multiple service delivery location roles each with 
     * its own attributes. For example, a Podiatric clinic and 
     * Research clinic may meet on alternate days in the same 
     * physical location; each clinic uses its own mailing address
