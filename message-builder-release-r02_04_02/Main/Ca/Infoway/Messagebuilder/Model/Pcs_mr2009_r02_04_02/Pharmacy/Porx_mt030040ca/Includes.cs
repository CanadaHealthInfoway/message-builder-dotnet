     * <p>An essential part of most prescriptions is the 
     * authorization to dispense. Multiple repetitions are included 
     * to accommodate circumstances where multiple drug products 
     * may need to be dispensed to complete a therapy. E.g. 100 x 
     * 20mg tablets and 50 x 10mg tablets. The association is 
     * marked as Populated because the authorization to dispense is 
     * a critical portion of a prescription. However the 
     * association is allowed to be 'null' when the order is for a 
     * medication which requires no dispense authorization (e.g. 
     * over-the-counter medications), or when the patient already 
     * has sufficient supply of the medication on hand to complete 
     * the therapy.</p> <p>Identifies the instructions for how the 
     * prescribed medication should be dispensed to the 
     * patient.</p>
