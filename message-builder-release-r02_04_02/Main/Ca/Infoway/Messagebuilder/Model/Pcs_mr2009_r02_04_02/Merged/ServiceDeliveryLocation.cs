     * <remarks><p>A role played by a place at which services may 
     * be provided. The RIM defines two specializations of service 
     * delivery location: 1. incidental service delivery location - 
     * A role played by a place at which health care services may 
     * be provided without prior designation or authorization and 
     * 2. dedicated service delivery location - A role played by a 
     * place that is intended to house the provision of services. 
     * Scoper is the Entity (typically Organization) that provides 
     * these services. This is not synonymous with 
     * &quot;ownership&quot;. This can be further characterized by 
     * a role code of: A)DedicatedClinicalLocationRoleType - A role 
     * of a place that further classifies the clinical setting 
     * (e.g., cardiology clinic, primary care clinic, 
     * rehabilitation hospital, skilled nursing facility) in which 
     * care is delivered during an encounter or 
     * B)DedicatedNonClinicalLocationRoleType - A role of a place 
     * that further classifies the setting in which non-clinical 
     * services are delivered. A given physical place can play 
     * multiple service delivery location roles each with its own 
     * attributes. For example, a Podiatric clinic and Research 
     * clinic may meet on alternate days in the same physical 
     * location; each clinic uses its own mailing address and
