	/// <summary>
	/// Hl7 datatype CS. backed by a Code.
	/// Coded data in its simplest form, where only the c is not predetermined. The c system and c system version 
	/// are fixed by the context in which the CS value occurs. CS is used for cd attributes that have a 
	/// single HL7-defined value set.
	/// CS can only be used in either of the following cases:
	/// - for a cd attribute which has a single HL7-defined c system, and where c additions to that value set 
	/// require formal HL7 action (such as harmonization.) Such cd attributes must have type CS.
	/// - for a property in this specification that is assigned to a single c system defined either in this 
	/// specification or defined outside HL7 by a body that has authority over the concept and the maintenance 
	/// of that c system.
	/// For example, since ED subscribes to the MIME design, it trusts IETF to manage the media type. This includes 
	/// that this specification subscribes to the extension mechanism built into the 
	/// MIME media type c (e.g., "application/x-myapp").
	/// For CS values, the designation of the domain qualifier will always be CNE (cd, non-extensible) 
	/// and the context will determine which HL7 values to use.
