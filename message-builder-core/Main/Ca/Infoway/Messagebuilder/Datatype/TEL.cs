	/// TEL HL7 datatype.
	/// Represents CeRx's notion of a telecommunication address, such as a phone
	/// number, fax, email or http address.
	/// There are several parts to an tel address, but HL7 has dumped all the relevant 
	/// information into a single text field. Urp.
	/// The first part is the URL scheme. This is something like tel: or http:. CeRx limits 
	/// these based on the subclass of TEL (TEL.PHONEMAIL or TEL.URI).
	/// There are some number of uses for each address. CeRx limits this to three, which is
	/// not enforced by this class. For the TEL.URI subclass, use is not permitted at all.
