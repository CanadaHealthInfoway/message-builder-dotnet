	/// HL7 datatype CE. Backed by a Code.
	/// Coded data that consists of a cd value and, optionally, cd value(s) from other coding systems that 
	/// identify the same concept. Used when alternative cs may exist.
	/// Note: The use of this data type has been reviewed and the recommendation is to use CD instead. Namely 
	/// because the only difference between CD and CE was the use of the qualifier property, which is no longer 
	/// being used for this release.
