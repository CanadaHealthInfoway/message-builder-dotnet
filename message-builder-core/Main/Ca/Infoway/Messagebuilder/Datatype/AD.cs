	/// AD.BASIC:  Used to communicate addresses for simple display, mailing and contact purposes.  
	/// The data type is not generally suitable for registries.
	/// AD.FULL:   Used to communicate fully validatable addresses. Usually appropriate only for registry-type situations.
	/// AD.SEARCH: This type is used to convey high level address information for searching purposes. All matches are 
	/// considered to be "starts with" for each specified property.
