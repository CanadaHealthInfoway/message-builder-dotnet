	/// Uncertain Range.
	/// This data type is used when a continuous range needs to be expressed. 
	/// For URG(TS.DATE) This data type is used when an occurrence is tied to a specific date, 
	/// but the actual date is not known, merely the range of dates within which the date falls. 
	/// This differs from IVL(TS.DATE) in that it refers to a single occurrence rather than a period 
	/// covering multiple days.
	/// For URG(PQ.x): This is used to express a single quantity whose specific value is not known, but 
	/// whose upper and lower bounds are known. The URG data type already places implicit constraints on 
	/// probability. Outside the range, probability is 0, within the range, probability is unknown. PQ.x 
	/// implies any of the PQ.x data types in the specification (e.g. PQ.LAB, PQ.DISTANCE), not the PQ data type by itself.
