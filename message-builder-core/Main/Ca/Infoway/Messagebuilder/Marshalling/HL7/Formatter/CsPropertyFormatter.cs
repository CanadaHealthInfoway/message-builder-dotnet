	/// CS - Coded Simple
	/// Formats a enum into a CS element. The element looks like this:
	/// &lt;element-name code="RECENT"/&gt;
	/// According to CeRx: code has a limit of 20 characters. This limit is not
	/// currently enforced by this class.
	/// HL7 implies that variations on this type may use a different name than "code" for
	/// the attribute. The use in the controlActProcess is given as an example.
