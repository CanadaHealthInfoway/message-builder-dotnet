     * physician in charge. This model conveys the correct 
     * semantics, but is inconsistent with other uses of 
     * &quot;author&quot; participation in POIZ models. Any changes 
     * here will have to be reconciled with other projects using 
     * this same cmet.</p> <p>Allows various Providers to attach 
     * comments to an existing record, and thus improving 
     * cross-provider communications.</p> <p>This is a list of 
     * comments made about the record by providers. Information 
     * captured here includes the provider making the comments; and 
     * excludes information that would render the record invalid. 
     * This information will only be seen when another provider 
     * reviews the record. Urgent or targeted messages should be 
     * sent using a different mechanism (e.g. phone).</p>
