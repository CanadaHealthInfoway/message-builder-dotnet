     * <summary>Business Name: Response Object</summary>
     * 
     * <p>Supports the business request to be able to specify 
     * expected response to this query</p> <p>This is an optional 
     * output control parameter. Sender indicates via coded values 
     * which class or class attributes in the response model are to 
     * be valued in the response. By site agreement codes can be 
     * based upon local object model, or alternatively, the classes 
     * and attributes from the query response model, as in the 
     * example below. Example: requestor wants provider identifier, 
     * name and service delivery location data returned so 
     * ResponseObject is valued as 
     * follows:</p><p>&lt;ResponseObject&gt;&lt;value 
     * code=&quot;HealthCareProvider.id&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ResponseObject&gt;</p><p>&lt;ResponseObject&gt;&lt;value 
     * code=&quot;PrincipalPerson.name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ResponseObject&gt;</p><p>&lt;ResponseObject&gt;&lt;value 
     * code=&quot;ServiceDeliveryLocation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ResponseObject&gt;</p><p>Utilized 
     * to support cases when a source or consumer (such as a Health 
     * Authority) wants only specific information about a given set 
     * of providers. For example, a HA might want to know all the 
     * Work Locations for a given provider type, and wouldn't want 
     * to receive all information. The type of information expected 
     * in the response is provided via the response object.</p>
